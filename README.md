# 🧪 104.1 Create Partitions and Filesystems

## 🛠️ What I Did in This Lab
I created disk partitions using tools like fdisk, gdisk, and parted. Then, I applied filesystems using commands like mkfs.ext4, mkfs.xfs, and mkswap. Finally, I reviewed how Btrfs can support advanced features like compression and subvolumes

I’ve included some helpful links to guide you through the lab and for studying afterward:

## 1️⃣ Manage MBR and GPT Partition Tables
🔹 Use fdisk for MBR Partitioning

🔹 Use gdisk for GPT Partitioning

🔹 Use parted for Interactive Partitioning

## 2️⃣ Create Filesystems Using mkfs
🔹 Format to ext4

🔹 Format to XFS

🔹 Format to VFAT (FAT32)

🔹 Format to exFAT

## 3️⃣ Create and Enable Swap Space
🔹 Create a Swap Partition

🔹 Verify Swap

## 4️⃣ Explore Btrfs (Basic Feature Knowledge)
🔹 Create a Btrfs Filesystem

🔹 Mount with Compression (zlib or lzo)

🔹 Create a Subvolume

## 🎯 What I Learned
In this lab, I learned how to manage both MBR and GPT partition tables using CLI tools. I practiced creating and formatting different filesystems and enabling swap. I also got a hands-on introduction to Btrfs and its advanced features like compression and subvolumes. This lab improved my confidence with disk preparation and partition management in a Linux environment.
